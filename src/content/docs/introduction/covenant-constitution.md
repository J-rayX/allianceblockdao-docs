## Covenant

### Vision and Mission

AllianceBlock is building the world's first globally compliant decentralized capital market. Our solution is built on the principles of Censorship Resistance, Transparency and Openness. Our vision for the future rests on integrating three core principles that embody our approach, strategy and technology. AllianceBlock’s platform and services are aimed at realising a Decentralized, Collaborative and Sustainable Capital Market that brings together issuers, participants, institutions, traders, experts, advisors, other service providers and even talent.

### What do we bring to the table?

AllianceBlock bridges the gap between TradFi and DeFi by providing a suite of key protocols and infrastructure elements that enable decentralized finance applications, sometimes also called DeFi legos, or building blocks. Web2 and Web3 organisations can build on top of these building blocks to integrate with DeFi and to build ever more advanced and sophisticated financial products. AllianceBlock thereby reduces time to market and development costs for all who use its building blocks and helps innovators accelerate their vision.
How are we planning to accomplish this?

AllianceBlock is changing the dynamics of Capital Markets by making the assessment, selection and governance of issuers and their projects community driven. In our framework, participants “earn” a Reputation Score, which weighs their influence in the collaborative decision-making process with regards to the projects. Our reputation-based approach to market influence is an alternative to traditional approaches where the largest participants get preferential treatment. With AllianceBlock the flow of Capital becomes more objective, fairer and participative, what we call Participative Capitalism.
What is our long-term goal?

AllianceBlock’s long-term goal is the transformation of the current global economy into one that is truly decentralized, inclusive and participatory.
