# What can you do with the DAO?

The DAO allows for two general proposals: **proposals with direct binding actions** and **governance proposals**.

## Proposals with direct binding actions

The DAO allows the community to vote on **binding actions** that will result in changes made to AllianceBlock’s smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Those binding actions are (initially):

- Funding a community project by transferring a portion of the DAO’s resources to a grant vesting contract.

## Governance proposals

Some proposals are not as simple as adding or removing an item from a list, they require community signaling, discussions and implementation paths. Those proposals should be submitted through a three-stage governance process that starts with a poll and ends with a binding proposal.

The voting process includes three steps: a Pre-Proposal Poll, a Draft Proposal, and a Governance Proposal. Each tier will have progressively increasing submission and passage thresholds to ensure important governance decisions are made by a representative majority (based on Voting Power). Each step must reach the defined VP threshold to be promoted to the next one. VP is a weighted sum of a wallet’s NXRA holdings. More on that topic can be found in the [DAO User Guide.](https://www.notion.so/DAO-User-Guide-1c6699c357014a8cbb56ef072eb60d1e?pvs=21)

**Note: The AllianceBlock DAO is currently in the first phase of decentralization, which  allows core team members to create proposals and community members to cast the votes. The thresholds below are for community generated proposals, which start in Phase 2. More on the 5 phases of progressive decentralization [here](https://www.notion.so/How-the-DAO-works-4c20a6f86619404198bbb82e3bd3088b?pvs=21).**

### **Stage 1: Pre-Proposal Poll**

- Submission Threshold: 1 VP
- Goal: Introduce a governance issue to the community, gauge community sentiment, and determine if there is enough support to move forward with drafting an initial proposal.

### **Stage 2: Draft Proposal**

- Submission Threshold: 2 VP
- Goal: Present a potential policy to the community in a structured format and formalize discussion about the proposal’s potential impacts and implementation pathways. A Draft Proposal that fails or does not reach this threshold can be amended and resubmitted one time.

### **Stage 3: Governance Proposal**

- Submission Threshold: 3 VP
- Passage Threshold: 50 VP and simple majority of participating VP
- Voting Period: 1 Week
- Goal: Formalize the passed version of a Draft Proposal into a binding Governance outcome.

It is important to notice that anyone who meets the submission threshold can take a passed proposal (either a Poll or a Draft) and move it to the next stage, not only the proposal author.

## **What about modifying the governance smart contracts?**

Right now, the DAO owns the governance smart contracts. Any modifications to either of these contracts must be carried out by the DAO Committee – groups of trusted and elected persons tasked with ensuring the continued security of these important pieces of AllianceBlocks infrastructure.

The DAO Committee must vote through a multi-sig wallet to approve any changes to the governance contracts, preventing a rogue Committee member from introducing a vulnerability.

Currently, there are no predefined paths for modifying the governance contracts via the DAO’s UI. This is to ensure the continuity of the organization and its operations during the initial stages of the transition to DAO governance. In time, said modifications will also be up for discussion at the DAO’s discretion.
