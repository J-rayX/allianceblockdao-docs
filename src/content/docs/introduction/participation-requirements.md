# Participation Requirements

Broadly speaking, DAOs are organizations comprising token holders. In AllianceBlock’s case, the tokens needed to be a member of the DAO are NXRA. By holding 5,000 NXRA or more, you may vote on proposals and even create them in later stages. 

At AllianceBlock we believe in the power of collective intelligence, the ability of a group to collectively perform tasks and make decisions that are more intelligent than an individual would be able to perform alone. Following that line of thought, we think all votes should be treated equally. That’s why in the AllianceBlock DAO each NXRA holder gets 1 vote regardless of how much he holds. 

Additionally, there are certain actions you can perform that signal long-term commitment to the AllianceBlock DAO that will increase your voting weight. These actions currently include:

- Staking in the Hardcore 4yr No Mercy Campaign (100% filled)
- Staking in [Fundrs](https://fundrs.app/funder/staking), our own merit & reputation based financing platform.

For more information, see the Voting Power section in the [DAO User Guide](https://www.notion.so/DAO-User-Guide-1c6699c357014a8cbb56ef072eb60d1e?pvs=21).

Anyone is allowed and welcome to participate in discussions related to the DAO in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hF7AGgt) or any of AllianceBlock’s other social channels, but only token holders can cast votes and create proposals.
