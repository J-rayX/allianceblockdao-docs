# 11 NoMercy Methods

Our 11 NoMercy Methods:

# 1. NoMercy Feedback

We thrive on this and practice it. We value our community tremendously and love hearing your feedback. Both the bad and the good. We NEVER consider feedback as negative, feedback is by definition constructive and always given with the DAO’s benefit as a priority. We inherently believe people do their best, we never assume and we always seek to understand. Feedback is never personal. Mistakes WILL happen - we crave mistakes because they provide the best opportunities to learn & improve. We let go and move on.

# 2. NoMercy Curiosity

We are in an industry that is changing daily. We need to keep ahead and avoid getting wrapped up. We step back and make the time to absorb information for ourselves.

# 3. NoMercy Vision

We all know the mission with absolute clarity. If not, we ask. We demand and expect regular updates around how the DAO is tracking against the mission & vision.

# 4. NoMercy Planning

Before starting any activity we STOP... and make time to plan and visualize the steps, key results, metrics and dependencies. We know that careful planning is key to exceptional results. But we are always realistic with what is really achievable. We appreciate and celebrate the value of data to achieve better outcomes.

# 5. NoMercy Focus

We agree on the plan and we stick to it with the utmost discipline. We
also often need to close the door and shut out the world. Tell people when this is time
needed. We block this time and respect it.

# 6. NoMercy Delegation

We never delegate what we haven't mastered. We ensure every task / project has an owner and contributor(s). If we are the delegating owner, it's our responsibility to give context and connection to the mission. If we are contributing, we’re absolutely clear on the bigger picture. 

# 7. NoMercy Recharge

We know that full power & performance require fresh batteries which means quality rest & recuperation (fact). We respect & cherish this time for ourselves and each other, no matter what.

# 8. NoMercy Ownership:

We don't wait for someone else to take charge. We step up and let others know where we need support. We own our success but also our mistakes (which we celebrate as the best moments to learn and improve).

# 9. NoMercy Bravery

If things are not working, we call it out and speak up. Nothing is off the table, ever. We are bold in our thinking and ideas. We push the limits of what is possible, don't settle for average.

# 10. NoMercy Partnerships

When engaging with any external vendor or partner, we take the time to explain our NoMercy culture and method, to ensure they understand these values and calibrate with them.

# 11. NoMercy Diversity

We all have the capability to learn & evolve. We crave diversity of thought and opinion. We have zero tolerance towards “that’s just how they are”. Be curious.
