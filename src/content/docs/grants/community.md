# Community Grants

The AllianceBlock DAO possesses an NXRA fund that has been set aside to help sponsor and facilitate the continual growth of the AllianceBlock ecosystem. One avenue used by the DAO to achieve these goals is the Grants Program.

This Grants Program allows any member of the community to request funding to help reimburse their efforts in growing the AllianceBlock ecosystem.

Grants can be requested by completing a proposal-form within the DAO. If approved by the community, then the DAO Committee will execute the transfer of funds to the grant beneficiary by means of a one-time transfer, or a vesting contract.

## **Grant categories**

Grant requests can fall under one of two broad categories: **Community & Content** & **Builder** These two categories represent areas of AllianceBlock that benefit most from community contributions.

## **Community & Content**

Growing, educating, moderating, and maintaining a healthy community of builders and users is important to AllianceBlock’s success. Grants under this category may fund activities such as:

- Community education
- Outreach and event organization
- Moderation

Projects might also include creating documentation, tutorials, videos, or other forms of content intended to educate and support the community.

Applicants to this category may need to provide portfolios of related work within their grant requests for the community to review.

## Builder

AllianceBlock is an open source ecosystem with many moving parts. Grants within the Builder category should motivate and reward impactful contributions from developers and engineers in the form of:

- New features & integrations
- Bug or vulnerability fixes
- Other improvements to existing code

## **Grant tiers**

Grants may be requested for any amount within one of three possible tiers, regardless of the grant category. For example, you may request a Builder grant in either Tier 1 or Tier 2.

The specific tiers, and their ranges, are:

### Tier 1

- Up to $5,000 USD in NXRA
- One-time payment
- VP Threshold: 500 VP

### Tier 2

- $5,000 - $50,000 USD in NXRA
- 2 months vesting contract
- VP Threshold: 1,000 VP

## **When are payments made for each tier?**

### Tier 1

Funds for grants in Tiers 1 are transferred directly to the beneficiary address within a week of the grant’s approval from the DAO.

### Tier 2

Funds for grants in Tier 2 are made available to the beneficiary address via vesting contracts. These contracts vest every second. Within a week of the grant’s approval, the owner of the beneficiary address may withdraw any vested funds.

## **Grant requirements**

- Every Grant must be approved by the DAO community through an open proposal on the Snapshot platform under the Grants category.
- Any work funded by the DAO must comply with the AllianceBlock **Covenant and Constitution.**
- Regardless of category, each grant proposal must include clearly defined and measurable outcomes.
- Grant recipients must provide regular and thorough reports on their project’s progress for the community to review. These reports may be shared through the Discord server. Failure to provide these reports may result in the revocation of grant funding.
- Failure to provide the pre-established outcomes, as well as to provide clear reports on the advances and milestones will result in the removal of the grant funding.
- Grants with one-time payments are to be transferred upon the DAO’s approval of the grant.
- Grants with vesting contracts have a one-month cliff beginning 7 days after the grant’s approval in the DAO.
