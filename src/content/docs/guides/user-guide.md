## Logging In

To get started with the DAO, visit the [AllianceBlock DAO Commonwealth page.](https://commonwealth.im/allianceblock-nexera-token/) [](https://commonwealth.im/allianceblockdao/discussions)

Here, you must connect a wallet in order to use the DAO. Make sure the wallet you’re using holds the relevant tokens for participating in the DAO (NXRA).

After connecting your wallet you will be taken to the homepage of the DAO featuring a list of all currently active proposals.

## Voting Power

Voting power is calculated from the total balance of NXRA & specific ecosystem actions associated with the wallet connected with the DAO. **The DAO looks at both your staked and unstaked balances, so you do not need to unstake any NXRA to achieve your full voting power.** 

### How is voting power calculated?

Voting power is represented as **“VP”**. At AllianceBlock we believe in the power of collective intelligence, and have therefore created a voting system in which all votes are created equal and voting power can only be increased by performing certain actions in the ecosystem that signal long-term commitment to the AllianceBlock mission and vision. 

VP is calculated as follows:

- The base VP is 0
- Holding 5,000 NXRA or more grants 1 VP
- Holders with Bronze Tier status in [Fundrs](https://fundrs.app/funder/staking) are granted an additional 0.25 VP
- Holders with Silver Tier status in Fundrs are granted an additional 0.5 VP
- Holders with Gold Tier status in Fundrs are granted an additional 1 VP
- Holders with Platinum Tier status in Fundrs are granted an additional 2 VP
- Holders who have staked in the Hardcore 4yr NoMercy pool are granted an additional 1 VP.

**VP is capped at 4 per individual,** which is achieved by having more than 5,000 NXRA, Platinum Tier status in Fundrs and having staked in the Hardcore 4yr NoMercy Pool.

### What happens if your voting power changes before a proposal closes?

If your NXRA balance changes, it will affect your voting power, but only on proposals that are created after your balance changes.

The moment a new proposal is created, the DAO calculates their voting power. In other words, when you vote on a proposal, the voting power of your vote will be equal to the balance you had at the instant the proposal was initially created. You may vote with that VP, then change your NXRA balance, unstake, etc. without affecting the weight of your vote.

### Approval & Rejection Conditions

Depending on the type of proposal, a certain amount of participating VP is needed to consider the vote valid. This is called the **Acceptance Threshold** for the proposal. Once the acceptance threshold has been met, a proposal is approved if the total voting power in favor of the proposal is greater than the total voting power against the proposal. This is the typical 50/50 majority model we expect to see in most democratic votes.

The only type of proposal that do not follow this rule are the **Pre-proposal polls**. Since these proposals are considered a non-binding mechanism to gather community feedback around an idea, they do not have predefined Yes/No options for voting. Users might add more than two options making them a multiple choice poll. It is important to mention that if the Pre-proposal polls reach the Acceptance Threshold defined of 125 VP, they might get promoted to a **Draft proposal** and end up being a binding **Governance proposal**.

## Browsing proposals

To view all proposals in the DAO, visit [the AllianceBlockDAO Commonwealth page](https://commonwealth.im/allianceblock-nexera-token/). This page collects all Pre-proposal polls and Governance proposals (imported from Snapshot). Here you can view and filter various proposals by category, outcome, etc.

### Viewing a proposal

To read a proposal, just click on the proposal’s title to view the details page.

Each proposal detail page includes all of the descriptive information provided by the person who submitted the proposal.

In the case of governance proposals, you’ll also find links to the proposal’s Snapshot page.

### Participating in the discussions

As a governance platform, the AllianceBlock DAO is most effective when paired with frequent discussion within the community. In an early stage, these discussions happen on Discord, and when sufficiently focused, these discussions are turned into specific threads on Commonwealth. 

Before casting your vote, please take the time to view and join in on these forum discussions. 

## Voting

To vote on a proposal, log into the DAO at [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/allianceblockdao.eth) with a wallet that contains NXRA. Only NXRA holders may vote on proposals in the AllianceBlock DAO. The current minimum balance to participate is 5,000 NXRA, which grants 1 voting power (VP).

To vote on a proposal once you’ve connected your wallet, simply view the proposal’s detail page and click the **VOTE YES** or **VOTE NO** button, or select one of the multiple choice options if it is a poll, according to how you’d like to vote.

Make sure that you read the full proposal so that you understand the issue being discussed and what will happen if the proposal is approved or rejected.

After clicking the Vote button, your connected Ethereum wallet will prompt you to sign the transaction. Remember, this is only a signed transaction, and requires no gas fee.

You will be given the option of adding the proposal to your watch list, this is a nice way to track the proposals you’re interested in. If you don’t want to add the proposal to your Watchlist, just click **No thanks**.

After submitting your vote, you can change it at any time leading up to the end of the voting period - as shown in the proposal’s detail page.

The DAO calculates your voting power for each individual proposal at the moment each proposal is created. If your VP changes after this moment, it will not affect your vote on that proposal.

## Creating a proposal

Currently, only DAO Committee Members can create proposals and the community can have it’s voice be heard. In the next phase of decentralization, holders will also be able to participate by creating a proposal themselves that the community can then take forward towards execution.

## Proposal Categories

Proposals often require community signaling, discussions and implementation paths. These proposals should be submitted thorugh a three-stage governance process that starts with a poll and ends with a binding proposal.

The voting process includes three steps: a Pre-Proposal Poll, a Draft Proposal, and a Governance Proposal. Each tier will have progressively increasing submission and passage thresholds to ensure important governance decisions are made by a representative majority (based on Voting Power).

### Pre-proposal Poll

This is the first step to get to the final binding Governance proposal. Polls in the AllianceBlock DAO are non-binding, multiple choice questionnaires that may be used to measure the community’s general opinion or sentiment regarding different issues. They are non-binding in that the DAO does not automatically act on the results of any of these polls. If a pre-proposal poll gathers enough support, it might get promoted to Draft proposal.

### Draft Proposal

A Draft Proposal presents a potential policy to the community in a structured format and formalizes the discussion about the proposal’s potential impacts and implementation pathways. A Draft Proposal that fails or does not reach this threshold can be amended and resubmitted one time. If a Draft proposal gathers enough support, it might get promoted to a binding Governance proposal.

### Governance Proposal

This is the last step of the Governance process and is the only one that is binding. This proposal must flesh out all the details, data, methods, assesments or any other relevant information for implementing this proposal. A Governance proposal is accepted if it meets the acceptance threshold of 50 VP and the Yes option gets a simple majority.

## Deleting a proposal

Proposals can only be deleted by the person who created them.

To delete one of your proposals, navigate to the details page of the proposal you want to delete. Click **Delete Proposal** at the bottom of the right hand column. You will have to confirm your deletion.

Be careful! Deleted proposals cannot be restored!

It is not possible to delete a proposal after people have voted on it. Deleted proposals with binding actions will not be enacted by the DAO Committee.
